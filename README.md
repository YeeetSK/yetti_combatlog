### Features
- Spawn a ped when a player disconnects from the server for a certain amount of time
- View character name and r* license with copy button for Players Info

- Other players can rob the ped (which clones the players inventory)
- Once the player joins back, the items in the players inventory are set to what remained in the "stash" (clone of the inventory) which could be robbed from
- Configure how much time you give the player to join back before players can rob the ped and configure how much time players have to rob the ped
- If the player joins back within the time he's given to join back, his combatlog ped is deleted and the "stash" is cleared so players can no longer steal from it

- Combat system, if player isn't in combat other players cannot rob him
- Detection for holding a weapon, taking damage or punching

- All options are toggles, so you can turn off robbing or the combat system off if you don't like it
